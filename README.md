# Amazon S3 Bucket 1 Liner Pwnage

A 1 Liner AIO Tool to check for Vulnerable Amazon S3 Buckets as part of Bug Bounty, the uniqueness of this tool is that it can take a file full of buckets, and check all of them with various attack scenarios if they are vulnerable.

As we manage to perform Bug Bounty we write our own scripts that perform various attacks as part of quickly testing for vulnerabilities & exploits.

Its from my personal collection library as part of a methodology that allows quickly to check for false positives or specific exploitation of various vulnerabilities.
